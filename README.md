# Board Game Assignemnt for 02180 Intro to AI
## Description
This is a hand-in for the first mandatory assignment for the course 02180 Intro to AI. This includes 2 Python3 scripts. kalaha.py is an implementation of the game Kalaha in Python3 that includes an option to play against an AI. The AI algorithm is minimax with alpha-beta pruning and depth cutoff. simulations.py was used to simulate AI vs. AI games for the purpose of collecting data.
## Game Installation and Usage
Have Python3 installed on your machine. Run kalaha.py using Terminal/Command Prompt, or a suitable IDE. Upon running the script, a menu will be shown where the user is propmted to choose the type of game they would like to play.

## Simulations
In simulations.py, use the function run_sim(n, ai1_depth, ai2_depth) to run n number of matches between two AIs with a specific cutoff-dept. The function should output a barplot comparing the results between the two players.
